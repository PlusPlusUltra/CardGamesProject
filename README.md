# CardGamesProject
This is a really easy web application. It is used to view Yu-Gi-Oh! cards from the database of yugiohprodeck.com. You can search cards in the database by name and then you can add them to your deck pressing the buttons on the top right and a few more things. It's that simple.
It's stil really minimal, there are a lot of improvements that can be done, but we don't know if we are ever going to work on this project again. Feel free to clone the repository or to take anything that can be useful for you, or even to ask anything if you need it.

## Credits
